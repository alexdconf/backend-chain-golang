# Backend-chain Golang
The purpose of this project is to create a basic, as basic as possible, blockchain implementation which can be used as the distributed and decentralized backend for a forum application.

The motivation for this project is that I have an idea for a forum but I do not want to have to pay a cloud provider for hosting to make it happen.

I hope this ends up being useful.
